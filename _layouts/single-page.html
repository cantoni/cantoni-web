              Get answers from real people, fast. Through Jelly, hundreds of thousands of people got answers to their pressing questions on iOS and web, and thousands more answered questions to power our knowledge engine. I was Product Manager at Jelly until our acquisition by Pinterest in 2017.

                <h3>Jelly Voice</h3>
                As product manager and lead engineer, I helped expand Jelly's reach so our users could effortlessly get answers over voice interfaces. We launched on the Google Home, then expanded to Amazon Alexa. <a href="https://vimeo.com/195830765">Watch the video</a> to get a sense of how Jelly worked.

                At Nice Mohawk, we built Ita, a list-making app for iPhone and iPad. We loved our list-making app, and shipped two major versions (and dozens of updates) before discontinuing support in 2016.
